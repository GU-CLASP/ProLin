\abstract{ In this paper, we study the formalisation of a dialogue
management system using proof-search on top of a linear logic.

We argue that linear logic is the natural formalism to implement
information-state dialog management.  We give particular attention to
modelling question-answering sequences, including clarification
requests, and argue that metavariables, arising from unification in
the proof search, play a decisive role in providing a natural
formalisation.

We show that our framework is not only well suited from a theoretical
perspective, but it is also suitable for implementation, having
implemented it and as well as several examples on top of it.  }
