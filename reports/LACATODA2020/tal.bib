@phdthesis{schlangen-diss,
abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the syntax, compositional semantics and contextually-situated interpretation of a certain kind of non-sentential utterance occuring in dialogue, namely one where the utterance, despite its ‘incomplete’ syntactic form, is intended to convey a proposition, a question or a request. Perhaps the most prominent type of such utterances is the short answer, as in “A: Who came to the party? — B: Peter.”, but there are many other types as well. Following (Morgan 1973) and (Ginzburg 1999b) and others, we will call such utterances fragments. Clearly, the interpretation of fragments is highly context dependent. We will provide evidence that there are complex syntactic, semantic and pragmatic constraints governing the use of fragments. In particular, following (Ginzburg 1999b), we will present evidence that while the main resolution must be semantic, some limited syntactic information nevertheless has to persist beyond the boundaries of sentences to allow for the formulation...},
